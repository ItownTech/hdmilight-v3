WARNING: This version is incomplete

This is a still-in-progress update to my hdmilight-v2 project.
This version moves everything onto one board, no longer needing a separate Papilio FPGA board.
Additionally it removes the AVR CPU from within the FPGA design and adds an ARM Cortex MCU to the board instead. This fixes the lack of any spare memory for program code.
